# SQL-Inverse-Multiplexer

Currently, enterprise applications can only work on one database at one time. We are working with iCognition to improve a software that allows enterprise applicants to connect to several database at one time, collates the results and returns those results to the application. The software would be transparent to the application and would not require any changes to the application's existing SQL.

2. Project Milestones
Goal 1: SQL Inverse Multiplexer for MS SQL (Tabular Data Format)
Goal 2: Support for stored procedures.
Goal 3: SQL Inverse Multiplexer for Postgres. There are some projects which facilitate most of the required features, however stop short at "transparency", requiring the applications to generate specific SQL to query across databases.

4. Key Stakeholders
The Australian National University: a national research university located in Canberra, the capital of Australia. 
iCognition: a techniqual company helping clients to maximise the value of their information assets, while minimising cost and risk.
 
8. Project Impacts
Rather than rely on the applications to implement this functionality, we are improving the software which can intercept calls to the database from the application and distribute those calls to several databases, collate the results and returns those results to the application. The software would be transparent to the application and would not require any changes to the application's existing SQL.
